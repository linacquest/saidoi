# SAIDOI: An Open-Source Standard for User-Centric AI Deployment, Optimization, and Integration

# Introduction
**SAIDOI** (Standard for AI Deployment, Optimization, and Integration) is a comprehensive framework aimed at making AI systems more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for users with limited technical expertise. By focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and AI explainability, SAIDOI seeks to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and their practical applications.

# Paper
An article is currently under review in the Journal "Expert Systems with Applications" by Elsevier (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/expert-systems-with-applications). Please stay tuned.

# Core Principles
### Universality: Ensuring AI systems are accessible to a wide range of users.
### User-Centricity: Prioritizing end-user understanding, ease of interaction, and accessibility.
### Transparency: Making AI processes and decisions understandable.
### Modularity: Designing systems with interchangeable and scalable components.
### Scalability: Facilitating the growth and adaptation of AI systems to meet evolving needs.

# Essential Components
### System Descriptions: Detailed documentation of AI system functionalities.
### User Interface Guidelines: Best practices for designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
### Data Specifications: Standards for data input, storage, and processing.
### Performance Metrics: Criteria for evaluating AI system performance.
### Ethical Considerations: Guidelines for ensuring ethical AI deployment and usage.

# Framework Overview
SAIDOI provides a blueprint (**example.pdf**) for developers to create AI systems that are not only advanced but also user-friendly. The framework includes guidelines for system descriptions, user interface design, data handling, performance evaluation, and ethical considerations.
