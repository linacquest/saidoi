# SAIDOI: An Open-Source Standard for User-Centric AI Deployment, Optimization, and Integration

# Introduction
SAIDOI (Standard for AI Deployment, Optimization, and Integration) is a comprehensive framework aimed at making AI systems more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for users with limited technical expertise. By focusing on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and AI explainability, SAIDOI seeks to bridge the gap between advanced AI technologies and their practical applications.

# Core Principles
Universality: Ensuring AI systems are accessible to a wide range of users.
Transparency: Making AI processes and decisions understandable.
Modularity: Designing systems with interchangeable and scalable components.
Scalability: Facilitating the growth and adaptation of AI systems to meet evolving needs.

# Essential Components
System Descriptions: Detailed documentation of AI system functionalities.
User Interface Guidelines: Best practices for designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.
Data Specifications: Standards for data input, storage, and processing.
Performance Metrics: Criteria for evaluating AI system performance.
Ethical Considerations: Guidelines for ensuring ethical AI deployment and usage.

# Literature Review
This framework is grounded in a comprehensive review of existing literature on HCI principles and AI explainability. The review highlights the necessity for a user-centric approach to enhance the effective and prompt use of AI systems.

# Framework Overview
SAIDOI provides a blueprint for developers to create AI systems that are not only advanced but also user-friendly. The framework includes guidelines for system descriptions, user interface design, data handling, performance evaluation, and ethical considerations.

# Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
To ensure robust referencing, the resulting SAIDOI blueprints generated by future developers by applying this standard should have a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This will facilitate tracking and referencing of the framework's applications.
